## Additional Info
### How was it built?
- SwiftUI
- MVVM Architecture
- URLSession and Swift Concurrency (async/await) for Networking
- No 3rd party libraries

### Focus areas for personal development
- Good Architecture, Good Project structure and following best practices for SwiftUI
- Making Views Reusable
- Experimenting with UI Design (eg: NavigationLink styling on the Home Screen)
- Getting better at Testing 

### Future Directions/ Feature Suggestions
- fetch a list of activities
- allow user to save activities locally (tbd: `CoreData`, `GRDB`, `Realm`)
- allow user to start and complete activities. (`ActivityKit`/ Live Activities, Timer API)
- use `WidgetKit` to make a Random Activity Widget 
- Remind user to complete activities (`UNUserNotification`)

- make custom backend to remove reliance on 3rd party service (tbd: `Spring Boot`, `Vapor`)
